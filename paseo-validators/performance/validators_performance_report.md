# Validator Performance Report:

Effective from Q3 2025, all infrastructure providers on the Paseo Testnet — including validators, system chain collators, and RPC providers — must comply with the performance and reliability requirements outlined in [PAS-11](https://github.com/paseo-network/paseo-action-submission/blob/main/pas/PAS-11-Providers-Requirements.md) Providers Requirements
. These requirements, measured on a quarterly basis, determine eligibility for quarterly payments.

This quarterly report uses the [Turboflakes Paseo Dashboard](https://apps.turboflakes.io/?chain=paseo#/dashboard) as its primary data source.
